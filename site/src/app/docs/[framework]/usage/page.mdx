# Usage

The main interface you'll interact with throughout your app is that of the `css`
function, created via `createHooks` as shown in the
[Getting started](./getting-started) guide.

You can make use of hooks anywhere you find a `style` prop that you'd like to
enhance with state-driven styles like `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, or
`:disabled`, to name just a few. For example, consider the case of a simple
button:

<CodeExample name="initial" framework={props.params.framework} />

You can access hooks simply by "wrapping" the style object in a `css()` call:

<CodeExample name="cssWrap" framework={props.params.framework} />

And now it's possible to add, say, a `:hover` state:

<CodeExample name="hoverHook" framework={props.params.framework} />

Note that hooks are prioritized by the order in which they are defined, with the
last hook overriding any previously-defined properties. For example, in the
typical case that _:disabled_ styles need to override other states, you should
apply the `:disabled` hook last:

<CodeExample name="hookOrder" framework={props.params.framework} />

Finally, keep in mind that hooks compose via nesting, allowing you, for example,
to apply hover styles only when the button is enabled:

<CodeExample name="composition" framework={props.params.framework} />
