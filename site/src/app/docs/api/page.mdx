# API

The foundation of the CSS Hooks API is the default-exported function:

## `hooks: (style: PropertiesWithHooks) => Properties`

The `hooks` function accepts a style object, optionally incorporating hooks, and
returns a flat style object that is compatible with your framework's `style`
prop.

The style object works exactly like you're used to, the key difference being its
support for nested style objects keyed by [hook type](./hooks-reference). For
example, to change the color of a link on hover, you would use the `hover` hook
as follows:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```tsx
<a
  href="#"
  style={hooks({
    color: "blue",
    hover: {
      color: "lightblue",
    },
  })}>
  Hover me
</a>
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Hooks are prioritized by the order in which they are defined, with the last one
having the highest priority. For example, `active` styles typically override
`hover` styles, so they should be defined after:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```tsx
<a
  href="#"
  style={hooks({
    color: "blue",
    hover: {
      color: "lightblue",
    },
    active: {
      color: "pink",
    },
  })}>
  Click me
</a>
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

It's also possible to combine hooks via nesting, e.g.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```tsx
<a
  href="#"
  style={hooks({
    color: "blue",
    hover: {
      hover: "lightblue",
    },
    disabled: {
      color: "gray",
      hover: {
        color: "lightgray",
      },
    },
  })}>
  Don't click me
</a>
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}
