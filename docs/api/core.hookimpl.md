## HookImpl type

Represents a basic hook implementation, using CSS syntax to define a selector or at-rule.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type HookImpl =
  | `${string}&${string}`
  | `@${"media" | "container" | "supports"} ${string}`;
```

## Remarks

Two types are supported: 1. A selector, where `&` is used as a placeholder for the element to which the condition applies. The `&` character must appear somewhere. 2. A `@media`<!-- -->, `@container`<!-- -->, or `@supports` at-rule. The value must begin with one of these keywords, followed by a space.

These can be combined using the [Condition](./core.condition.md) structure to form complex logic.
