# Getting started

---

## 1. Installation

CSS Hooks offers a dedicated {props.params.framework.replace(/^[a-z]/, x =>
x.toUpperCase())} integration to ensure a seamless developer experience. Install
this via NPM or your package manager of choice, e.g.:

<Pre>
  <Code>npm install @css-hooks/{props.params.framework}</Code>
</Pre>

---

## 2. Create hooks

To address a wide range of use cases, CSS Hooks is fully configurable, allowing
you to define your own hooks. To keep things as simple as possible, let's start
with a single `&:hover` hook. Create a new module in your project, e.g.
`src/css.ts`, and copy the following example:

<Pre>
  <Code className="language-typescript">
    {`// src/css.ts

import { createHooks } from "@css-hooks/${props.params.framework}";
    
export const [hooks, css] = createHooks({
  "&:hover": "&:hover",
});`}
  </Code>
</Pre>

---

## 3. Add static CSS

The `hooks` export from the module created in Step 2 consists of a static CSS
string that must be included somewhere on the page. This could be achieved in
any number of ways, but the easiest is simply to add a `<style>` element in your
root component, e.g.:

<Pre>
  <Code className="language-tsx">
    {`// src/App.tsx

import { hooks } from "./css";

export default function App() {
  return (${
    "\n" +
    [
      "    <>",
      "      " +
        (props.params.framework === "solid"
          ? `<style innerHTML={hooks} />`
          : `<style dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: hooks }} />`),
      "      <h1>Hello world</h1>",
      "    </>",
      "  );",
      "}",
    ]
      .map(x => x + "\n")
      .join("")
  }`}
  </Code>
</Pre>

---

## 4. Use hooks

Now you're ready to use your configured hooks. Simply import the `css` function
and apply it to your style object. The style object continues to work exactly
the same as in {props.params.framework.replace(/^[a-z]/, x =>
x.toUpperCase())}'s `style` prop API, except that it allows you to leverage your
hooks by nesting additional style objects.

```tsx
// src/Button.tsx

import { css } from "./css";

export default function Button(props: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button
      {...props}
      style={css({
        color: "black",
        "&:hover": { color: "blue" },
      })}
    />
  );
}
```
