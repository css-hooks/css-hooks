# Configuration

To address a wide range of use cases, hooks are fully configurable. This
flexibility means you can use our "recommended" hooks as a starting point and/or
create your own custom set of hooks if you prefer.

## Recommended hooks

_Note: Requires TypeScript version 5.3 or later._

To get up and running with some sensible defaults, you can install
`@css-hooks/recommended` via NPM or your package manager of choice, e.g.:

```bash
npm install @css-hooks/recommended
```

Then, in your `src/css.ts` module (or equivalent), you can import and use the
`recommended` function to conveniently configure a number of useful hooks:

<Pre>
  <Code className="language-typescript">
    {`import { createHooks } from "@css-hooks/${props.params.framework}";
import { recommended } from "@css-hooks/recommended";

export const [hooks, css] = createHooks(recommended({
  breakpoints: ["500px", "1000px"],
  colorSchemes: ["dark", "light"],
  pseudoClasses: [
    ":hover",
    ":focus",
    ":active",
    ":disabled",
  ]
}));

/* Hooks created:
 - @media (width < 500px)
 - @media (500px <= width < 1000px)
 - @media (1000px <= width)
 - @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)
 - @media (prefers-color-scheme: light)
 - &:hover
 - &:focus
 - &:disabled
 - &:active
*/`}
  </Code>
</Pre>

To combine these with additional custom hooks, simply spread the returned
object:

<Pre>
  <Code className="language-typescript">
    {`import { createHooks } from "@css-hooks/${props.params.framework}";
import { recommended } from "@css-hooks/recommended";

export const [hooks, css] = createHooks({
  ...recommended({
    // configuration for recommended hooks
  }),
  // custom hooks
);`}
  </Code>
</Pre>

---

## Custom hooks

In cases where the `recommended` function doesn't provide what you need, you can
fall back to defining custom hooks using the base hook configuration format.
That is, a record with each entry consisting of a _hook name_ (the alias used to
reference the hook in the `css` function) and a _hook spec_ (a description of
the hook's functionality). For example:

<Pre>
  <Code className="language-typescript">
    {`import { createHooks } from "@css-hooks/${props.params.framework}";

export const [hooks, css] = createHooks({
  ${props.params.framework === "solid" ? '"my-hover"' : "myHover"}: ":hover",
  ${props.params.framework === "solid" ? '"my-active"' : "myActive"}: ":active",
  ${props.params.framework === "solid" ? '"my-dark"' : "myDark"}: ".dark &",
});`}
  </Code>
</Pre>

### Hook specs

A hook spec uses CSS syntax to define the functionality of the hook. It can
consist of selector logic, a container query, a media query, or a logical
combination of any of these.

#### Selectors

A hook that activates when the element matches a selector can be represented
with a _selector_ spec, e.g.

- **`"&:hover"`**: Activates when the cursor is positioned over the element.
- **`":checked + &"`**: Activates when the previous sibling matches the
  `:checked` pseudo-class.
- **`".group:hover &"`**: Activates when an ancestor element has the `group`
  class and matches the `:hover` pseudo-class.
- **`".dark &"`**: Activates when an ancestor has the `dark` class.

Selector specs use native CSS selector syntax, but with `&` as a placeholder for
the element where the hook is applied (i.e. the element where the `css` function
is used). For an overview of CSS selectors, see
[CSS selectors (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors).

#### Container queries

A container query hook activates when the specified container condition(s) are
matched, e.g.

- `"@container (width > 500px)"`
- `"@container (width > 500px) or (height > 500px)"`
- `"@container (width > 500px) and (height > 500px)"`

Similar to pseudo-class and selector hooks, container query hooks support native
CSS syntax. To learn more, see
[@container (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@container).

#### Media queries

A media query hook activates when certain media types and/or features are
matched, e.g.

- `"@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)"`
- `"@media (max-width:499px)"`
- `"@media print"`

As with other types, media query hooks use native CSS syntax. For more
information about media queries, see
[@media (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media).

#### Feature queries

A feature query hook activates when certain support conditions are matched, e.g.

- `"@supports (display: grid)"`
- `"@supports (transform-origin: 5% 10%)"`
- `"@supports font-format(woff2)"`

Feature query hooks, like others, use native CSS syntax. For more information
about feature queries, see
[@supports (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports).

#### Logical combination hooks

A logical combination hook combines any of the previously-defined hook types. It
consists of an object with a single key `and` or `or`, whose value is an array
of other hook specs joined by that operator.

For example, the following hook could be used to implement an advanced dark mode
that would allow you to override the `prefers-color-scheme` media query based on
a user setting:

```typescript
export const [hooks, css] = createHooks({
  dark: {
    or: [
      "[data-theme='dark'] &",
      {
        and: ["[data-theme='auto'] &", "@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)"],
      },
    ],
  },
});
```
