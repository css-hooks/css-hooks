# Configuration

To address a wide range of use cases, hooks are fully configurable. A set of
[recommended hooks](./hooks-reference) is provided for your convenience, but you
can extend or replace these with your own custom hooks as needed.

To start, let's review the default configuration shown in the
[Getting started](./getting-started) guide:

```typescript
import { createHooks, recommended } from "@css-hooks/react";

const [css, hooks] = createHooks(recommended);
```

If you aren't interested in the recommended hooks, you can simply replace them
with your own hooks:

```typescript
import { createHooks } from "@css-hooks/react";

const [css, hooks] = createHooks({
  myHover: ":hover",
  myActive: ":active",
  myDark: ".dark > &",
} as const);
```

Now the `hooks` function will allow you to use the three hooks you've
configured:

```tsx
function Component() {
  return (
    <a
      href="https://css-hooks.com"
      style={hooks({
        color: "blue",
        myHover: { color: "lightblue" },
        myActive: { color: "red" },
        myDark: {
          color: "lightblue",
          myHover: { color: "white" },
          myActive: { color: "pink" },
        },
      })}
    >
      Hooks
    </a>
  );
}
```

Another option is to include the recommended hooks along with any custom hooks
you'd like to add. To do this, simply define a custom configuration object and
spread the `recommended` hooks:

```typescript
import { createHooks, recommended } from "@css-hooks/react";

const [css, hooks] = createHooks({
  ...recommended,
  groupHover: ".group:hover &",
  dark: ".dark &",
} as const);
```

## Hook spec

Each entry in the configuration object defines the name of a hook along with a
spec describing its CSS representation. Let's take a look at each of the
available hook types.

### Basic pseudo-classes

A hook that activates when the element matches a pseudo-class can usually be
represented with a basic pseudo-class spec, e.g.

- `":hover"`
- `":active"`
- `":nth-child(2n+3)"`

The spec must start with a `:` character and uses native CSS syntax for
pseudo-classes. For an overview of pseudo-classes that you might use, see
[Pseudo-classes (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes).

### Selectors

A hook can also implement complex selector logic, e.g.

- **`":checked + &"`**: Activates when the previous sibling matches the
  `:checked` pseudo-class.
- **`".group:hover &"`**: Activates when an ancestor element has the `group`
  class and matches the `:hover` pseudo-class.
- **`".dark &"`**: Activates when an ancestor has the `dark` class.

Selector specs use native CSS selector syntax, but with `&` as a placeholder for
the element where the hook is applied (i.e. the element where the `hooks`
function is used). For an overview of CSS selectors, see
[CSS selectors (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors).

### Container queries

A container query hook activates when the specified container condition(s) are
matched, e.g.

- `"@container (width > 500px)"`
- `"@container (width > 500px) or (height > 500px)"`
- `"@container (width > 500px) and (height > 500px)"`

Similar to pseudo-class and selector hooks, container query hooks support native
CSS syntax. To learn more, see
[@container (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@container).

### Media queries

A media query hook activates when certain media types and/or features are
matched, e.g.

- `"@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)"`
- `"@media (max-width:499px)"`
- `"@media print"`

As with other types, media query hooks use native CSS syntax. For more
information about media queries, see
[@media (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media).

### Logical-or hooks

A logical-or hook combines any of the previously-defined hook types, activating
when one of the conditions is true.

A common use case for this is adding vendor prefixes, e.g.
`{ or: [":read-write", ":-moz-read-write"] }`.
