## <Code className="language-typescript">createHooks(\_: HooksConfig) => [CSS extends string, HooksFn]</Code>

Given a hook configuration, this function produces a static style sheet, which
must be added to the document, along with a `hooks` function that supports the
configured hooks.

## <Code className="language-typescript">type HooksFn = (\_: WithHooks&lt;CSSProperties&gt;) => CSSProperties</Code>

The `hooks` function accepts an object consisting of CSS properties and nested
hook objects, flattening it to produce a properties object compatible with the
`style` prop.

## <Code className="language-typescript">type HooksConfig = Record&lt;HookName extends string, HookSpec&gt;</Code>

This configuration object defines which hooks to support, which is reflected in
the `hooks` function and its corresponding style sheet.

## <Code className="language-typescript">type HookSpec</Code>

A `HookSpec` is a specific type of string that defines the condition under which
a hook applies, following one of these formats:

- **`":<pseudo>"`**, where `<pseudo>` is any
  [pseudo-class](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#pseudo-classes) such as
  `hover`, `active`, or `focus`.
- **`"<selector>"`**, where `<selector>` must contain an `&` character
  functioning as a placeholder for a base selector. For example, a value of
  `":checked + &"` would produce a hook that is activated whenever the element
  is immediately preceded by a `:checked` element.
- **`"@container <query>"`**, where `<query>` can be replaced with any
  [container query](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-contain-3/#container-rule)
  condition.
- **`"@media <query>"`**, where `<query>` can be replaced with any
  [media query](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/) condition.

An additional type of `HookSpec` allows the hook to be activated whenever any
one out of a list of conditions applies. It is defined using an object:

- `{ or: (HookSpec & string)[] }`
