# Introduction

CSS Hooks starts with the idea that the `style` prop provides the ideal
developer experience for styling UI components—or at least that it _would_ if
not for its well-known technical limitations (like inability to represent a
simple hover effect or responsive behavior). This library helps you to overcome
most of those limitations—without build steps, runtime style injection, or even
much of a style sheet. If it sounds too good to be true, you're not alone in
this belief. But read on, and you'll find that an obscure CSS technique provides
just the mechanism we need to challenge some deeply-held assumptions about
inline styles. It's built on CSS Variables, but you probably haven't seen them
used quite like this.

## CSS Variables

Here's how a conventional use case for CSS Variables might look:

```html
<span style="--success-color: green; color: var(--success-color)">...</span>
```

Notice that the `var()` function is a simple reference to the `--success-color`
property, making the whole inline style equivalent to `color: green`. In this
trivial example, the use of a variable clearly doesn't provide any benefit; but,
since these so-called _custom properties_ can be inherited from ancestor
elements, you can use them to avoid repeating a value (like a color) throughout
your application, or even for more advanced use cases (like theming).

Especially when considering inheritance, it's easy to imagine a scenario where
you might reference a custom property that hasn't been set. Fortunately, the
`var()` function accounts for this possibility by allowing you to specify a
fallback value, e.g. `var(--success-color, #0c0)`—`#0c0` being the fallback
value to use in case `--success-color` isn't set or is set to an _invalid
value_.

## The fallback trick

The
[CSS Custom Properties spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables/#guaranteed-invalid)
describes two special values that, in conjunction, actually make CSS Variables
_programmable_:

1. The `initial` value of a custom property is a _guaranteed-invalid value_.
2. An empty value written explicitly, e.g. `--foo: ;` is a _valid value_.

In other words:

1. When you reference a variable whose value is `initial`, the fallback value
   will be used instead.
2. When you reference a variable whose value is empty, that empty value will be
   used (but it will have no effect on the
   [declaration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Syntax#css_declarations)).

With this knowledge, you can do the unthinkable—implement a hover effect within
an inline style:

```html
<a href style="color: var(--hover-on, #18659f) var(--hover-off, #003665)">
  Hover me
</a>
<style>
  * {
    --hover-off: initial;
    --hover-on: ;
  }
  :hover {
    --hover-off: ;
    --hover-on: initial;
  }
</style>
```

As you can see, a style sheet is technically still required, but it only
controls the states of the `--hover-off` and `--hover-on` variables, allowing
you to toggle between arbitrary values defined within the inline style. Because
it doesn't define any presentational values, this hover "hook" can be used over
and over again throughout your application without any additional CSS overhead.

## The pitfalls of the fallback trick

Although the mechanism underlying the fallback trick is quite simple, actually
using this technique _directly_ is a bit complicated. The pain points include:

1. **Defining "hooks".** Although the "hook pattern" in the style sheet does
   click after a while, this remains a tedious and repetitive task.
1. **Aligning variable names.** Just as with a class name, you need to ensure
   that the variable names in the style sheet match the ones referenced in the
   markup.
1. **Challenging syntax.** CSS Variable syntax is widely regarded as less than
   beautiful, and it is even less readable when using the fallback trick.
   Combining multiple states (e.g. `:enabled` + `:hover`) requires nested
   expressions, compounding this issue.
1. **No type safety.** The type safety of the `style` prop doesn't extend to
   variable references or fallback values since they are embedded in a string.
1. **No auto-completion.** Lacking type information, your code editor won't be
   able to help you much to implement the pattern successfully.

## CSS Hooks

This library allows you to harness the power of the fallback trick through a
familiar, convenient, and type-safe interface. Here's how it works:

1. Defining a hook is as easy as writing a CSS selector or at-rule.
1. The underlying variables are created automatically, so you don't need to
   worry about naming, scoping, or maintaining references.
1. The familiar syntax of the `style` prop is extended to allow you to leverage
   your hooks through nested style objects. You don't even see the underlying
   variables!
1. The type safety of the style object syntax is extended to include hooks.
1. Native TypeScript auto-completion makes hooks easy to use, with no need to
   install any additional editor extensions.
